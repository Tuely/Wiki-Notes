## Agent configuration Details in VM
Remote Machine: C:\Agent1 

Steps To create a new agent in VM
### Download Agent from VSO 
- Open Internet Explorer
- Navigate to your VSO account
- Click the Administer Account gear in the upper right hand corner of the screen
- Select Control panel
- Click Agent pools tab
- Click the Download agent link
- Save the file to your Downloads folder
- Right-click agent.zip
- Select Properties
- Ensure the file is unblocked
### Extract the file to Agent1 folder 
- Right-click agent.zip
- Select Extract All
- Enter C:\Agent1
- Click Extract
### Run ConfigureAgent.cmd in elevated command prompt 
- Press the Windows key
- Type CMD
- Right-click Command Prompt
- Select Run as administrator
- Navigate to the folder where you extracted the file contents
- Run ConfigureAgent.cmd
- You can either use the default name or have the name match the folder name, which in my case is Agent1
- Now enter your Visual Studio Online URL
- Enter the agent pool to which you would like to add this agent. 
- Every Visual Studio Online account is created with two Agent Pools: Default and Hosted.  You are free, however, to create additional agent pools from the page where you downloaded the agent. 
- Accept the default working folder 
- You have a choice to decide where you would like the agent to store the files it will be working with during builds and releases. 
- Answer N 
- Because we are going to be running Selenium tests we will want to run the agent in interactive mode. 
- Sign in to your Visual Studio Online account 

### Set up Agent in Interactive Mode
- Enable automatic log in 
- Open the Run dialog 
- Press Windows Key + R
- Type “control userpasswords2”
- Press enter
- Uncheck the box for “User must enter a user name and password to use this computer.”
- Click the Apply button
- Enter the password for the user
- Click OK
- Click OK on the Users Accounts dialog
Now, every time your machine is rebooted the configured user will automatically log in to the machine. 

## Verify Agent is running in VM
Open command prompt in adminstrator  mode  Enter command c:\Agent1>run --startuptype autostartup
